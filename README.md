# World Weather Analysis

## Project OVerview
The goal of this project was to use Google Maps and Open Weather APIs to create an app that takes user input for a range of maximum temperatures in order to filter cities and hotel choices based on the client's preferences.  After the cities were filtered, 4 cities were chosen to create an itinerary with Google Maps.  The project was executed using Python with the pandas, gmaps, numpy, requests, and os libraries.  

## Results
